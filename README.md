# smart_calculator
Calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember previous calculations.

Smart calculator was developed based on a project at hyperskill.org: 
https://hyperskill.org/projects/74?track=2

It uses conversion from infix to postfix notation in order to calculate complex expressions e.g. 3 + 8 * ((4 + 3) * 2 + 1) - 6 / (2 + 1)

Part of the program is assignment of values to variables e.g. a = 5, that can later be used in an expression: a + 5, output: 10

Quit the program by writing '/exit'.
